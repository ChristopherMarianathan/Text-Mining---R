Insights derived
-----------------
The insight we get from this analysis is that toys must have a strong story component. 
This is probably why movie-based action figures have grown about 20% in 2019. 
Since XYZ Toy Manufacturing company are developing an original toy, they would have to develop a 
strong story component. Since the toy will be using speech, it can be a storyteller using descriptive 
and poetic language which can capture the imagination of children.
The story must have real stakes so that it builds anticipation among children and keeps them engaged.
